# Marine-derived nutrients
The following files and code are associated with the inner Bay of Fundy Atlantic salmon project run by Grace Bryson, Karen Kidd, and Kurt Samways. Field sampling occurred in 2015, 2016, and 2017 in Fundy National Park, New Brunswick, upstream and downstream of a natural barrier on the Upper Salmon River and Point Wolfe River. Isotope processing occurred at the Stable Isotopes in Nature Laboratory (Fredericton, New Brunswick).
