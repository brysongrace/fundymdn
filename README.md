# Marine-derived nutrients
The following files and code are associated with the inner Bay of Fundy Atlantic salmon project run by Grace Bryson, Karen Kidd, and Kurt Samways. Field sampling occurred in 2015, 2016, and 2017 in Fundy National Park, New Brunswick, upstream and downstream of a natural barrier on the Upper Salmon River and Point Wolfe River. Isotope processing occurred at the Stable Isotopes in Nature Laboratory (Fredericton, New Brunswick).

R code in the files "2015 means.R, 2016 means.R, 2017 means.R" were used to compare the isotopic composition of samples from different study sites. The following files (indicated with a star) were required to run the code:
- *PWdown15.csv
- *PWdown16.csv
- *PWdown17.csv
- *PWup15.csv
- *PWup16.csv
- *PWup17.csv
- *USdown15.csv
- *USdown16.csv
- *USdown17.csv
- *USup15.csv
- *USup16.csv
- *USup17.csv

R code in the files "MixSiar2015.R, MixSiar2016.R, MixSiar2017.R" were used to quantify the proportion of marine-derived nutrients in the diet of brook trout. The following files (indicated with a star) were required to run the code: 
- *PWcons15FINAL.csv
- *PWcons16FINAL.csv
- *PWcons17FINAL.csv
- *PWsource15FINAL.csv
- *PWsource16FINAL.csv
- *PWsource17FINAL.csv
- *UScons15FINAL.csv
- *UScons16FINAL.csv
- *UScons17FINAL.csv
- *USsource15FINAL.csv
- *USsource16FINAL.csv
- *USsource17FINAL.csv
- *tef16.csv

R code in the file "Boxplots.R" was used to create boxplots visualizing the proportion of marine-derived nutrients across years and sites. Additional files include "Returningsalmonnumbers.csv", used to plot the number and biomass of returning salmon each year, and "Sitelocations.csv" to create a map of the study area.
