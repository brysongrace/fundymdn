# Marine-derived nutrients
The following files and code are associated with the inner Bay of Fundy Atlantic salmon project run by Grace Bryson, Karen Kidd, and Kurt Samways. Field sampling occurred in 2015, 2016, and 2017 in Fundy National Park, New Brunswick, upstream and downstream of a natural barrier on the Upper Salmon River and Point Wolfe River. Isotope processing occurred at the Stable Isotopes in Nature Laboratory (Fredericton, New Brunswick). 

# Lab project
R code in the files "2015 means.R, 2016 means.R, 2017 means.R" were used to compare the isotopic composition of samples from different study sites. The following files were required to run the code:


R code in the files "2015 MixSiar.R, 2016 MixSiar.R, 2017 MixSiar.R" were used to quantify the proportion of marine-derived nutrients in the diet of brook trout. The following files were required to run the code:
